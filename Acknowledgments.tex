`Life may be tough, but I've got a God that's tougher'. Firstly, I would like to thank God for all his blessings, helping me complete my thesis. I would like to express my sincerest gratitude towards my adviser, Dr. Christopher Crick, who has supported me throughout my thesis with his creative ideas and invaluable suggestions. I could not have asked for a better adviser and certainly would not have completed the thesis without his time, support and guidance.

I would like to take this opportunity to also thank my parents, brother, sister-in-law and sisters for the suggestions, support and attention they have provided me throughout my life. Last but not the least, I thank my friends for their unwavering support.
